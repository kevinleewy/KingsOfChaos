                    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                    <p>
                        In Kings of Chaos, you are in command of an army of either humans,
                        elves, dwarves, orcs, or undead.  The aim of the game is to strengthen your
                        army to attack enemy warlords and take their gold! Players are ranked
                        so you can see how your forces stack up to everyone else.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To build up your attack and defense strength, you must recruit
                        soldiers and equip them with weapons. You may also hire mercenaries
                        or train your soldiers.  To
                        recruit soldiers you must have people click on your unique link
                        (you can find this in your <a href="#Command_Center">Command
                        Center</a>).  Each time you recruit an additional soldier, your
                        attack and defense strength will increase slightly, as will the
                        amount of gold you receive per turn. Also, for every two recruits
                        each of your officers gets, you will receive an additional soldier!
                        The number of officers you can have is unlimited, so the more people
                        who sign up to be your officer the faster you can build your army.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to those soldiers generated by unique link clicks,
                        you can choose to conscript soldiers - once
                        a day you will recruit a number of soldiers determined by your
                        current 'unit production' value.  This value can be upgraded on the
                        <a href="#Training">Training</a> page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To train your soldiers, use the <a href="#Training">Training</a>
                        page.  Soldiers can be trained to be specialists in either attack or
                        defense - whichever you choose, they will boost that ranking
                        further, while ceasing to contribute to the other ranking.  You can
                        also train soldiers to become spies or sentries, which will be discussed in more
                        detail later.  In this case they cease to contribute to your
                        attack/defense strength and the amount of gold you get per turn, as
                        instead they are being kept in readiness for any covert missions you
                        may choose to send them on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can hire mercenaries on the
                        <a href="#Mercenaries">Mercenaries</a> page, but only up to a
                        strength of 25% of your total force - so for every 3 normal soldiers
                        you gain, you can hire one more mercenary.  Mercenaries contribute
                        to your attack or defense strength, but do not contribute to the
                        amount of gold you gain each turn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Weaponry can be purchased (and repaired, sold or scrapped) on the
                        <a href="#Armory">Armory</a> page.  For each race there are various weapons
                        available for both attacking and defending, becoming increasingly
                        expensive as they become more effective.  The exact strength of
                        each weapon in your armory is dependent upon its state of
                        repair (weapons become damaged during battles and must be
                        repaired to remain fully effective), and also your level of
                        siege technology and fortifications.  Higher levels of siege
                        technology and fortifications raise the strength of every single
                        weapon you possess, so they are well worth upgrading. You can upgrade
                        your siege and fortification levels on the <a href="#Command_Center">
                        Command Center</a> page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Covert Action is a general term for your Spy and Sentry ratings.
                        Your force of spies becomes more powerful by training soldiers
                        to be spies. Every spy you train increases your spy strength,
                        and therefore helps you move up in spy ranking. Also, if you conduct
                        many espionage missions spies will sometimes get caught, so you will
                        need to replace them. If your spy rating is high, you will be able to
                        see more players' gold on the battlefield without having to spy on them.
                        Your force of sentries becomes more powerful by training soldiers to
                        be sentries. Every sentry you train increases your sentry rating.
                        The higher your sentry rating, the harder it is for other players to
                        see your gold on the battlefield, spy on you or sabotage your weapons.

                        If you invest in spies or sentries you should upgrade your covert skill
                        when you can. Upgrading applies to your entire force of spies and sentries.
                        Upgrading covert skill, training spies and training sentries can all be done
                        one the <a href="#Training">Training</a> page.

                        Each race in Kings of Chaos has a particular area in which they
                        excel.  These can work to your advantage in gaining higher rankings,
                        so it is worth considering them before choosing your race:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Humans</b> earn 30% more gold each turn than the other
                            four races.  Since this can be used for just about anything, it is very flexible. Humans also have a 35% spy bonus.
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <li>
                            <b>Elves</b> are 45% better at recon (spying) and sabotage than any other
                            race.  This can be a great advantage when spying on or
                            sabotaging other people's armies. Elves also have a 70% casualty bonus so they lose fewer soldiers when attacked.
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <li>
                            <b>Orcs</b> attack with 35% more strength than the other
                            races.  The advantages to this are obvious, giving you a
                            much better chance of defeating other armies in combat. Orcs also have a 20% defense bonus that makes it more likely that they will withstand enemy attacks and keep their gold.
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <li>    <b>Dwarves</b> are 40% stronger at defending than any other
                                race.  This makes it more likely that they will withstand
                                enemy attacks, enabling them to keep their gold for
                                themselves. Dwarves also have a 15% income bonus, which gives them more gold per turn than all races except Humans.
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <li>    <b>Undead</b> are 35% better at hiding their gold and defending against
                                sabotage with their sentry bonus.  They also lose 50% less soldiers when attacked making
                                this a good protective race if you can't spend a lot of time on
                                the game.
                        </li>

                    <h2>Quick Start Guide</h2>

                    <p><b>Overview</b>
                    <p>
                        In Kings of Chaos, you are in command of an army of humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, or undead. To be successful, you must manage your army and defeat your enemies. You must keep your troops in top condition and recover from losses. A powerful army will be strong in all four aspects of the game: attacking, defending, spying, and sentry (counter-intelligence). This makes it important to keep your forces and efforts relatively balanced in all these areas.
                    </p>
                    <a name="recruiting"></a>
                    <b>Recruiting</b>
                    <br />
There are a number of ways to build your army and thus generate more gold and become more powerful:
<ul>
<li>You can get people to click on your Unique Link, giving you an additional soldier each time it is clicked.
  <ul>
  <li>Logged-in players may click a given Unique Link up to 5 times per 24 hours.</li>
  <li>Friends who click your link and aren't logged in can click your link once per 24 hours.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>If you tell friends about Kings of Chaos, you may recruit them as your officers:
  <ul>
  <li>If your friend clicks your Unique Link, then registers to play, you will receive a 50 soldier bonus!</li>
  <li>For every two soldiers your officers gain from their own Unique Links, you will gain an extra soldier for free!</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, you may buy mercenaries - soldiers that will fight for you but will not generate extra gold.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Getting Started (Creating/Activating your account)</b>
<p>To create an account and establish your presence in the Land of Chaos you must register and activate your username. To do this click the "Register" link in the Menu Bar on the left, fill out the requested information including an email address you have access to. You will then be sent an email with instructions on how to activate your Kings of Chaos account. Once you've done this, you are ready to log in and command your army. Congratulations! You are now a warlord in Kings of Chaos.

<p>You are now eligible to gain 50 soldier bonuses! When you have a KOC account and give your Unique Link to someone to click, the clicker will also be given the option to join your army as one of your officers - if they join you through this link, you will receive a 50 soldier bonus! For every two clicks/soldiers an officer receives, you will receive one soldier. (Without doing anything! Just for being their commander! Sweet.)

<p><b>Menu Bar</b>
<p>The Menu Bar contains most of the important features and tools of Kings of Chaos. Located on the left of the page, it allows you to navigate through different aspects of your army and manage your forces.

<p><b>Command Center</b>
<p>The Command Center is where you can see a broad outline of your forces.
<ul>
  <li>Your Recruiting Link is found at the top of the Command Center. This is the primary method many players use to build their armies. Give this link to your friends to recruit them as your officers, which quickly grows your army through signup bonuses and trickle-down from their own clicking. <a href="help.php#recruiting">Click here to learn how to recruit soldiers</a></li>
    <li>User Info shows your general contact information.</li>
    <li>Military Overview Shows you general military stats, such as what your siege level is at and what fortifications you have. It also shows you how much gold you have and how much you are generating.</li>
    <li>Officers that you may have show up under this heading. Officers help build your army, and you may also choose to work with them as close allies.</li>
    <li>Military Effectiveness shows you your Attack, Defense, Spy, and Sentry ratings, as well as how you are ranked against other KOC players in these categories. This section shows you how well you are doing and how you stack up to other players in each aspect of the game.</li>
    <li>Personnel shows you how your forces are distributed.</li>
    <li>Previous Logins gives you the IP addresses and times of the last five logins to your account.</li>
    <li>Preferences is where you go to modify the setting on your account. Be very careful in this section - many of the changes here cannot be undone.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Attack</b>
    <p>When you wish to venture out beyond the safety of your fortifications, click the Attack button. Here, you will view the Battlefield, a listing of other players ranked near you. Players in yellow are online and those in green are not currently signed into the game.  If you have previously reconned a player, you will see an eye in the first column which will link you to your intelligence log when clicked.  The amount of gold in a player's treasury will be displayed if your Spy Rating is much larger than the opponent's Sentry Rating. You can page through the battlefield and search for other armies to attack or spy on. Once you click on a player's name you will see their User Stats, where you can see basic info about the player, any officers the player has, and you can recognize the player as friend, neutral, enemy, alliance member, or ignored if you wish to ignore all messages from them. From the User Stats panel you can choose to send a personal message, or conduct an attack, recon, or sabotage mission.
<ul>
    <li>Attack Mission - If you attack successfully, you will steal a portion of the enemy's available gold based on the damage you inflicted and the relative sizes of your armies. There is also a chance that you or your opponent will suffer casualties, based on army size and damage inflicted. The actual damages/repairs are shown on your armory page and not in the attack log. The casualties are listed with mercenaries and soldiers under "your losses" and any covert (spy or sentry) losses are shown in the "details" of the attack log.</li>
    <li>Reconnaissance Mission - You can conduct Recon missions to view info about an opponent's fortifications and forces. The chance that the mission is a success is dependant on the overall strength of the spies you send, as well as the enemy's Sentry Rating. If the mission is not a success you will no longer lose a portion of the spies you sent. There are a maximum of 10 recons permitted on a specific target per 24 hours.</li>
    <li>Sabotage Mission - If your opponent has overwhelming defense or has been relentlessly assaulting you, perhaps you may choose to engage in sabotage. In these missions, when you send a number of spies you specify what type and quantity weapons you want to try to sabotage. If your spies make it past enemy sentries they will attempt to sabotage part of the enemy's armory. If you attempt to sabotage too much of the enemy's armory the sabotage will likely fail, and no sabotage mission is guaranteed to be successful.  If you fail in a sabotage mission, you may lose a portion of your spies and even some of the tools they carry. While there is no limit on the number of sabotage missions you may attempt, you are allowed a maximum of 10 successful sabotage turns against a player per 24 hours.</li>
    <li>Personnel and Military Effectiveness - When you are preparing to attack, you are also shown your army stats again so you can make sure you want to go through with the mission, and in the case of covert missions, how many spies you have to dedicate to the task. In general, if your opponent has a larger army TFF (total fighting force) than yours, you will steal more of their gold as a reward.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Attack Log</b>
<p> Here you can see details of ingoing and outgoing attacks. This can be a very useful way to see how much offensive and defensive damage you do on average, who you need to try to get protection from, or what armies you have had success with in the past. In your attack log you will see Attacks on You and Attacks on Others, and you will be able to page through the attacks if there are too many to fit on one screen.

<p><b>Armory</b>

    <p>Your Armory is where you keep track of your weapons, and keep them in fighting condition.
<ul>
    <li>Current Weapon Inventory is where you see the weapons you currently own, as well as their strengths. If your weapons are damaged, it is cheaper to repair them than to buy new ones. You can also sell weapons at a reduced rate for gold.</li>
    <li>Current Tool Inventory is where you see the tools for sentries and spies that you currently own. You can also sell spy and sentry tools at a reduced rate. Sabotaged tools will no longer be in your armory as they are removed when sabotaged. (Your spies are more observant than your regular soldiers!)</li>
    <li>Buy Weapons allows you to purchase new weapons for your forces. In general, the more expensive a weapon is, the stronger it is. Some weapons are unique to your race, while others can be bought by anyone.</li>
    <li>Buy Tools allows you to purchase new tools for your spies and sentries, making them much more effective.</li>
    <li>Upgrade Fortifications is where you can strengthen your permanent defenses. This makes it much more difficult to be attacked successfully. Fortifications strengthen your defensive units as a whole.</li>
    <li>Upgrade Siege Technology allows you to purchase new technologies to attack your opponents. This strengthens your army as a whole.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Training</b>
<ul>
    <li>Personnel shows you how many soldiers, mercenaries, spies, sentries, etc you have.</li>
    <li>Train Your Troops allows you train your untrained soldiers to be attack or defense specialists, or to be skilled in the subterfuge of spies and sentries. Here you can also revert any attack or defense soldiers to regular units.</li>
    <li>Upgrade Covert Skill makes all of your spies and sentries more powerful - it is a very effective way to increase the power of your covert forces.</li>
    <li>Upgrade Unit Production allows you to conscript soldiers from the local populace - each day this number of soldiers will join your forces.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Intelligence</b>
    <p>Your intelligence files are similar to your attack log, but they give you details of covert missions from and against you. Here you see details of Intercepted Intelligence Operations as well as Intelligence Files from missions you have conducted. Not all missions are intercepted and therefore you will not see everyone who has reconned you or sabotaged you. Not all recons or sabotages done by you were intercepted either, this is called "ghosting". When no missions are intercepted, that player has been "ghosted".

<a name="recruit"></a>
<p><b>Recruit</b>
<p> Recruiting is an effective way for you to build your army's morale, which eventually results in new recruits. When you recruit for another player by completing the CAPTCHA on the recruit page, your army's morale increases and they receive one soldier. When another player recruits for you, your army's morale drops, but you gain a soldier. Recruiting proceeds in this order: you, your friends, other members of your alliance, then finally any other users with positive morale (ordered by greatest morale). This means that the greater your morale, the quicker it will be converted into extra recruits.
<p> Only logged-in players can turn your army's morale into new soldiers. Non-logged-in friends can still increase your army size by clicking your unique link, found in your Command Center. <a href="help.php#recruiting">Click here to learn how to use your Unique Link to gain officers</a>

<p><b>  Mercenaries
</b>

<p>     On this page you can see the details of your current troops, and
        you can hire mercenaries.  Mercenaries can be hired as attack
        specialists, defence specialists, or all-purpose troops.  Once
        hired, they cannot be retrained.  Mercenaries cannot be spies, and
        do not contribute to the amount of gold you receive each turn, but
        they do boost your attack and/or defence strength (depending on
        what type of training they have).  Mercenaries become available
        for hire randomly and their numbers are limited so there are often
        none available shortly after that.  You can only have 25% of your
        army consisting of mercenaries. Mercenaries are added to your total fighting force (TFF) and they have to die to lower your TFF.

<p><b>Buddy List</b>
<p>The buddy list can be used to keep track of people who you recognize as either
neutral, friend, enemy, ignored or alliance members. You can recognize players via
the drop down on their stats page. You are allowed a maximum of 180 players per buddy type. (Hopefully that's 180 friends, not 180 enemies!)

<p><b>  Logout </b>

<p>     The Logout option on the menu will log you out from Kings of Chaos.
        This is useful if your computer is used by more than one person, to
        prevent others from accessing your Kings of Chaos account.  If you
        stop using the site for a length of time, you will be automatically
        logged out anyway - this is to help reduce the load on the extremely
        busy KoC webserver.
</p>

<p><b>  Messages
</b>

<p>     The Send Message page is accessed from a user's stats page, by
        clicking on the Send Message button.  You are then presented with
        a page which has areas for you to enter a subject and a message to
        be sent to that user.
</p>
<p>     When someone has sent you a message in this fashion, you will notice
        the message indicator beneath the main menu will change to show how
        many new messages you have waiting for you.  To read them, simply
        click on the red number and you will be taken to the Read Messages
        page.  The most recent message will appear at the top of the page,
        with older messages beneath it in reverse order of receipt.  You can
        use the buttons on the right to Reply to or Delete each message.

  All recruiters and tool developers must allow a Kings of Chaos admin a fully-functional test account to ensure compliance with these rules. If you are a developer and have questions, please email a Kings of Chaos admin. Kings of Chaos does not maintain a list of "approved" tools - updates to a previously-legal tool may make it illegal.

<a name="FAQ"></a>
<h2>    Frequently Asked Questions
</h2>
<p>   <b>How much does this cost to play?</b>
<br />  Nothing.  It's free.  Kings of Chaos is completely supported by our advertisers. Enjoy!
</p>
<p>   <b>How do I get a bigger and better army?</b>
<br /> <a href="help.php#recruiting">Click here to learn how to use your Unique Link</a>
</p>
<p>     <b>How are rankings calculated?</b>
        All players are ranked in each of the four categories of attack strength,
        defense strength, spy rating and sentry rating. These four rankings are
        added to give your overall ranking.
<p>     <b>What are the siege, fortification, and unit production levels?</b>
<br />
        We'd rather not say, and let you find out on your own =)
                <br>
</p>
<p>     <b>What happened to all my stuff?</b>
<br />  Age 17 has begun! At the beginning of each Age, we reset everyone's weaponry and army size to give everyone a fresh start.
        Now is the time to rebuild and prove yourself
        better than those around you!
</p>
<p>     <b>Why am I losing gold and soldiers?</b>
<br />  You are probably being attacked. Check your attack log to see who
        attacked you, how many soldiers they killed and how much gold they
        stole from you.
</p>
<p>     <b>How come I'm not listed in the rankings?</b>
<br />  Ranks are only recalculated once every hour, so you will have to wait
        until rankings are generated to appear on the rankings page.
</p>
<p>     <b>Why doesn't my rank improve when I get more weapons?</b>
<br />  Ranks are only recalculated once every hour, so you will have to wait
        to see how your ranking has been changed by upgrades or purchases.
</p>
<a name="allianceranking"></a>
<p>   <b>How are Alliance Rankings calculated?</b>
<br />  Alliances are ranked by summing 1/(userrank+1) for every member of the alliance who has set that alliance to be their primary alliance. Top 10 Alliances are ranked by members' overall rank, Fiercest Alliances are ranked by members' Strike Action rank, etc.
</p>
<p>     <b>Why can't I/my friends view the recruit page?</b>
<br />  Many AOL users cannot view our pages properly. We're sorry about the
        problem, and are looking into possible solutions.  In order to get the most from our web pages we
        recommend the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> web
        browser.
</p>
<p>     <b>It's hard to get people to click my link. Is there another way to
        gain recruits?</b>
<br />  The easiest way to gain recruits is to persuade friends to click your
        link, but you can also upgrade your Unit Production (on the Training
        page), and hire mercenaries to boost your army strength.
</p>
<p>     <b>Why don't I ever kill any enemy soldiers?</b>
<br />  The bigger your army, the more casualties you are likely to suffer.
        Armies small enough will not usually suffer casualties because this
        would hurt the army much more.
</p>
<p>     <b>How do I change my race?</b>
<br />  If you have played Kings of Chaos in a previous age, the first time you log
        in you will be asked to select the race you want to play for the
        rest of that age. If you are new you will choose your race when you
        register.  You cannot change your race once you have begun playing
        in any particular Age without resetting your account.
</p>
<p>     <b>I forgot my password, what should I do?</b>
<br />  Go to <a href="forgotpass.php">this page</a> and you can get your
        password emailed to you.
